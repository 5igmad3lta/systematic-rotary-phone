                <p>My name is <strong>Stavros Droulias</strong>. An aspiring Software Developer. My goal is to build a solid foundation in programming in order to help others create appealing and functional websites.
                That's not a self portait (although I do wish to be as a happy as this Quokka). It was actually an AI generated photo created through <a href="https://deepai.org/"><b>DeepAI</b></a>. When I'm not
                generating cool animal portraits, I'm at my day job working as Theatre Nurse.</p>

                    patient and collecting any information that could impact on the proposed anaesthesia.
